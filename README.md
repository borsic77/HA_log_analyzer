# ðŸ§  Home Assistant Log Summarizer

A proof-of-concept project that summarizes recent `home-assistant.log` entries using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini, either from within Home Assistant or via an optional Streamlit debug interface.

This repository includes:
- A Streamlit-based log viewer and LLM-powered summarizer in `streamlit_app/`
- A Home Assistant custom integration in `custom_components/log_summarizer/`

## Features

	â€¢	Filters and groups warnings, errors, and critical messages
	â€¢	Summarizes recent logs using GPT-4o-mini
	â€¢	Provides actionable fixes with context
	â€¢	Lets you choose a time window (e.g. last 24h)
	â€¢	Persistent notification and optional markdown output
	â€¢	Debug mode for viewing and exporting filtered logs



## Installing via HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

You can also install this integration via HACS as a custom repository:

1. In Home Assistant, go to **HACS â†’ Integrations**.
2. Click the three-dot menu in the upper right â†’ **Custom repositories**.
3. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/borsic77/HA_log_analyzer`
4. Select **Integration** as the category and click **Add**.
5. Youâ€™ll now see **Log Summarizer** available to install under HACS â†’ Integrations.
6. After installation, restart Home Assistant and follow the same configuration steps as below, starting from step 3.

This method ensures easier future updates and visibility through HACS.

## Installing as a Home Assistant Custom Component (ignore steps 1 and 2 if you use HACS)

1. Copy the contents of `custom_components/log_summarizer/` into your Home Assistant's `config/custom_components/log_summarizer/` directory.

2. In your `configuration.yaml`, add the following block (you can store the API key in `secrets.yaml`):

```yaml
log_summarizer:
  api_key: !secret openai_api_key
```

3. In `secrets.yaml`, add:

```yaml
openai_api_key: sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

To get your API key, create an account and generate a key at [OpenAI's API key page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

4. Restart Home Assistant.

5. Use **Developer Tools â†’ Actions** to call the `log_summarizer.summarize_logs` service and optionally provide the `file_path` and `model`.

## Optional: Run in Debug Mode with Streamlit

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HA_log_analyzer.git
cd HA_log_analyzer
```

### 2. Set up the virtual environment (using `uv`)

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

### 3. Add your OpenAI API key

Create a file called `.env` in the project root with the following contents:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/main.py
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Convert to a Home Assistant custom integration with manual service trigger
- [ ] Display summaries in Lovelace
- [ ] Optional deployment via add-on or Docker
